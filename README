This library is for use with the SparkFun Si4735 Shield or Breakout Board

Originally released under the 'Buy Me a Beer' license (if we ever meet, you
buy me a beer).

To the furthest extent that this is legally possible, the fork maintained by 
Radu - Eosif Mihailescu and published here https://github.com/csdexter/Si4735
is hereby released under the LGPL version 3.
To the furthest extent that this is legally enforceable, the copyright remains
with the authors listed above.

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

HARDWARE NOTES:
 * The Si4735 is a 3.3V I/O chip whereas the Arduino Uno/Mega are 5V I/O. This
   means you will need to use logic level shifters if you are trying to use
   the Breakout Board version with the latter. If you're using the Shield (or
   the Breakout Board with the 3.3V Arduino Pro Minis), this has already been
   taken care of for you.
   However, a design bug survived in the Shield and you will need a makeshift
   level converter in the form of a diode to make things work with an Arduino
   Uno/Mega, details here: http://wiki.wsartori.com/wiki/Trunet_Radio
 * If you're using the Breakout Board, you should connect a 32768Hz oscillator
   to the RCLK and DCLK pins since the code assumes that is the case. See the
   schematic for the Shield for reference.
 * Quick connection reference:
   SPI Mode, Si4735 -> Arduino:
     SDIO      -> MOSI    (Arduino output)
     GPO1      -> MISO    (Arduino input)
     SCLK      -> SCK     (Arduino output)
     #SEN      -> SS      (Arduino output)
     #RESET    -> D9      (Arduino output)
     GPO2/#INT -> D2/INT0 (Arduino bidirectional)
   I2C Mode, Si4735 -> Arduino:
     SDIO      -> SDA     (Arduino bidirectional)
     SCLK      -> SCL     (Arduino output)
     #SEN      -> tied high or low, tell the code which one with
                  SI4735_PIN_SEN_HW*
     #RESET    -> D9      (Arduino output)
     GPO1      -> left floating
     GPO2/#INT -> D2/INT0 (Arduino input)
                  or (left floating or tied high, if not using interrupts)
